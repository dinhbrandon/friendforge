* Unit tests

Finished unit tests, took me forever to realize had to use "python -m" before running pytest

## June 2, 2023

Today, I worked on:

* Redid migration tables and then updated user_accout table and queries

We learned migrations need to be sequential and we definitely have not done that. How we have them now definitely makes a lot more sense

## June 1, 2023

Today, I worked on:

* Continued working on websockets and then worked on deployment with Brandon

Deployment was definitely not as straight forward as we were hoping, we tried to trouble shoot a bit but was tough

## May 31, 2023

Today, I worked on:

* We all worked together on websockets

We worked together to create the backend for websockets, seems pretty promising. Learned a bit about ports for the connection

* Created the frontend page to display all of a user's groups

Learned more about jsx syntax and passing in props

## May 26, 2023

Today, I worked on:

* Learned about Tailwind, getting started on more frontend stuff

Lots to learn about Tailwind, DaisyUI, and all of Taylor's work on the frontend

## May 25, 2023

Today, I worked on:

* Finished groups backend with Brandon! Was a super good day and then later I revised profile interests so user can't add an interest more than once and created update group endpoint

Brandon and I had lots of revelations about edge cases that we didn't initially think of for quite a few endpoints.

## May 23-24, 2023

Today, I worked on:

* Continued backend groups endpoints with Brandon and Ramon

Some of the SQL statements can be pretty tricky so it was a little tough combining info from groups, our junciton table, and profiles as well as pulling user info into profiles.

## May 22, 2023

Today, I worked on:

* Creating admin interests page on the frontend and worked with Ramon to create groups endpoints

Started on frontend stuff a bit and then moved back to the backend to do more work with the junction tables for groups.

## May 19, 2023

Today, I worked on:

* Creating junction table and endpoints for user profile interests.

Brandon and I absolutely crushed it learning about junction tables and figuring out how to establish and use many to many relationships.

## May 18, 2023

Today, I worked on:

* Creating the Group Name model, making migrations,
and creating the endpoints for it

Was having issues with Docker and Gitlab and having multiple issue branches but getting used to it.

## May 16, 2023

Today, I worked on:

* Creating the Interests model, making migrations,
and creating the endpoints for it

Brandon, Ramon, and I started today on creating
the models and Taylor got started on the frontend.
I was a little uncertain at first of the type we
would use for interests since it's a set list.
Ended up just using a str.

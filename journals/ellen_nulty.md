Today, I worked on:

* Creating the Interests model, making migrations,
and creating the endpoints for it

Brandon, Ramon, and I started today on creating
the models and Taylor got started on the frontend.
I was a little uncertain at first of the type we
would use for interests since it's a set list.
Ended up just using a str.
